# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization with PyTorch

In the attached Jupyter notebook, I have presented the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [1] for a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. A QUBO belongs to the NP-hard class, and it is equivalent to find the minimum energy (ground) state of a spin (Ising) Hamiltonian [2]. Here, the implementation of QAOA is done using PyTorch.
